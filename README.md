# Runescape Invention Calculator

This is basically a refactor of the perk calculator found on the RuneScape wiki. 

## Description

I found the calculator to be useful, however I wanted to be able to brute force recipe combinations to find the best inputs for the desired perk outcomes. I have pulled out the calculation functions and modularized them to the latest JS standards.

## Original Calculator Code / Acknowledgement

The original calculator code and data can be found on the RuneScape wiki. I have also included the original code that I started with in `/orig`
